# Week 2

In this week, we will learn about **Latex**.

Since most of us get to know about Latex from the course moderated by Rwitaban.So you can go follow the [**LatexCourse**](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~rwitaban/LSLatex/).

We are not expecting you to be the Master of Latex. At this stage we only want from you that you become familiar with syntax & tags used in Resume-making.
So you must complete the **Week-1 & Week-2** material of the shared resources,so that you become quite familiar with basic formatting atleast.

Also you can go through the [**Latex-Tutorial**](https://youtu.be/fCzF5gDy60g) video on youtube,if you find reading resources is boring for you.
