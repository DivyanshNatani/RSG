# Week 0

## Python
Head over to this link - [Introduction to Python Data Types](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Welcome) and start with the topics in the 'Learn the Basics' sections one by one (till 'Basic String Operations'). These are official tutorials from the Python organisation which are well curated for beginners and contain an inbuilt Ipython shell for writing and executing your code there itself. 

If you are not of the reading kind, checkout this [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-mFu00qxl0a67RhjjZj3jXm) for step-by-step tutorials on Python basics (Tutorials #1 - #11 except #6, #7, #9). But make sure that you are following alongside with the video, otherwise things won't make sense later in the course. 

You can also read these concepts from GeeksForGeeks. They explain each concept in good detail along with examples. 

Irrespective of where you choose to read/watch from, you should be familiar with the following topics:
* [Strings](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-strings/?ref=lbp)
* [Lists](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list/?ref=lbp)
* [Tuples](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-tuples/?ref=lbp)
* [Sets](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-sets/?ref=lbp) 
* [Dictionary](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-dictionary/?ref=lbp)
* [Arrays](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-arrays/?ref=lbp)

Let us now explore how you can work with multiple variables at once in order to get your desired output. This is done using Operators.


Head over to this link - [Python Operators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-operators/?ref=lbp) for a detailed description of different operators in Python. Then check out the tabs in the navigation bar on the left and read about all the operators one by one. 
<br>These are extremely important as some of the concepts explained here will be used to define other concepts later on, and to understand any piece of code analytically, you should know what each line of code is doing. 
<br>You should be familiar with the following Python operators:
* Arithmetic Operators
* Relational Operators
* Logical Operators
* Bitwise Operators 
* Assignment Operators
* Identity Operators
* Membership Operators


Checkout this link for a detailed article on Conditions and Loops - [Conditions](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Conditions) and [Loops](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Loops)
<br> You can also refer to this link from GeeksForGeeks - [Conditions and Loops](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-if-else/?ref=lbp) (Checkout all the tabs in the navigation bar on the left)
<br> Again, if you prefer videos instead, refer to this [Youtube Playlist's](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-mFu00qxl0a67RhjjZj3jXm) Tutorial #6, #7 and #9. 

Make sure you have covered the following topics - 
* For loop
* while loop
* break statement
* continue statement
* If-else condition ( normal, nested, if-elif)

### Python Functions

A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation and produces output. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function, so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function.

This [Notebook](https://github.com/abhipaiangle/learners-space/blob/master/Python/Week%202/Notebook1.ipynb) covers the most aspects of Python Functions. Download the Notebook and make changes to the code and see how they reflect in the output.

If you want to read more on functions, you can have a look at [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functions-in-python/) and [this](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter3/)

If you prefer watching a video tutorial, watch this [Youtube Playlist's](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-mFu00qxl0a67RhjjZj3jXm) #12 Tutorial.

### Scope of a Variable

Scope refers to the visibility of variables. In other words, which parts of your program can see or use it. Variables that are defined inside a function body have a local scope, and those defined outside have a global scope. This means that local variables can be accessed only inside the function in which they are declared, whereas global variables can be accessed throughout the program body by all functions

### Recursion

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.




### Classes and Objects   
A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or **methods** that are common to all objects of one type. You can think of a class as a collection of many different functions and attributes (variables) that can be accessed by an object of that class. These methods inside a class are defined almost in the same way normal Python functions are defined, with a major difference being the 'self' argument and some special methods only found in a class body, for example:- the **'\_init_'** method, **'\_add_'** method, etc. 

An Object is a basic unit of Object Oriented Programming and a way to represent the classes you have declared in your program. And thus an object can also be sometimes called an instance of a class. Whenever you create an object of a class, you can access all the methods which you have declared in the body of the class. (Note that this is not possible in the case of Private classes (covered later)). 

You can check out any one of these detailed tutorials on Classes and Objects in Python based on your preference -
* **[Python Classes and Objects](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects)**
* **[Python Classes and Objects Detailed](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/class)**
* Detailed Video Tutorials on Classes and Objects - **[Video #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_Jp11xqCzg&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-l1MqB1zoYfqzlj_HH-ZzXt&index=2&t=0s)** and **[Video #2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQiUOV15IRI&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-l1MqB1zoYfqzlj_HH-ZzXt&index=2)** 
 
 


**Note:So what we want that "For Django purpose you must have basic knowledge of string operations and basic OOPS." So in the week 0, try to be familiar with these concepts.**




## HTML/CSS
WnCC along with Career Cell conducted Learner's Space [Web Dovelopment](https://github.com/wncc/learners-space/tree/master/Web%20Development), a 7-Week program which extensively covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap and Django in very discriptive manner. So, you can go through them, all, or any specific topic that you want to uderstand.

But, if you know HTML/CSS, we would suggest you to go through any HTML/CSS crashcourses (many 15min-1hr videos are available on youtube) of your choice and revise the concepts.

### Bootstrap
Do go through this website once [https://getbootstrap.com/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) and its sidebar. Bootstrap allows lots of pre-defined styles and feature that we can easily integrate in our project.

Do try to make a dummy website (will take 5 min with bootstrap) to check your knowledge! (Just fun exercise)
