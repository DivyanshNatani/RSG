# Week 0

## Python


## HTML/CSS
WnCC along with Career Cell conducted Learner's Space [Web Dovelopment](https://github.com/wncc/learners-space/tree/master/Web%20Development), a 7-Week program which extensively covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap and Django in very discriptive manner. So, you can go through them, all, or any specific topic that you want to uderstand.

But, if you know HTML/CSS, we would suggest you to go through any HTML/CSS crashcourses (many 15min-1hr videos are available on youtube) of your choice and revise the concepts.

### Bootstrap
Do go through this website once [https://getbootstrap.com/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) and its sidebar. Bootstrap allows lots of pre-defined styles and feature that we can easily integrate in our project.

Do try to make a dummy website (will take 5 min with bootstrap) to check your knowledge! (Just fun exercise)
